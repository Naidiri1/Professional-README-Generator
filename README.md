## About the project 

The main purpose of the project is to create a high quality Readme generator when we create an open source project on GitHub, this Readme generator app includes what the app is for, how to use it, how to install it, how to report issues and how to make contributions. The user can create a Readme by using the command line app to create one, this app helps the user to save some time creating one by his own and this app guides him by answering the questions and giving it details about the project he is creating to finally have a result of a complete Readme just by using the command line and it wil be created for him on those questions answered. 

## Installation 

In order to be able to use this Readme generator, the user needs to install a package.json by using in the command line `npm init` then the user will install the inquirer by using `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` in the command line and the `node modules` will be installed too, with the `package-lockjson.` 

## Description
