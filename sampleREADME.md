  ## Description 
  The main purpose of the project is to allow users to choose a movie to watch based on information about a movie and displaying its trailer to help decide to watch the movie in mind or choose another one based on those two factors. Achieving this functionality comes from the use of JavaScript, more specifically the server side API's within the JavaScript.

  ## Usage 
  The main page of this project is going to request a name of a movie from the user to look for information and a trailer, once the user chooses what movie to look for the user will press the button to search, and the user will be redirected to another page of resutls based on the movie searched, what the user will find in the results page will be infomration like: the name of the movie, plot, cast, language, run time, genre, rating based on Rotten Tomatoes and box office, and a trailer of the movie with the use of Youtube. These points of information and the trailer of the movie will be useful to the user to decide what movie to watch.
